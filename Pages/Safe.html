    <h2> Alcohol </h2>
    <p> Alcohol is one of the most famous drugs in The Netherlands.</p>
    <p> It is prohibited to drive if you are over the 0.5 blood alcohol level. Driving under the influence is a criminal
      offense and applies to driving a car and riding a motor bike, scooter, moped or bicycle. You risk a fine of NLG
      180 (between 0.5 - 1 blood alcohol level) and NLG 550 between 1 and 1.8 blood alcohol level. If you are over 1.8
      blood alcohol level your case will be taken to court. In addition to a fine, you may be temporarily banned from
      driving. This counts for driving a bicycle too!</p>
